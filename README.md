“A work of art which did not begin in emotion is not art.” - Paul Cézanne

The Shades of Warriors is an abstract painting that encapsulates the sentiment spectrum of University of the East (UE) students. Inspired by the hues of the Red Warriors, the gradience from burgundy to salmon is an extension of science into the artistic avenue bred by one question: *are the Warriors truly happy?* 

As the first module introduced the definitions of human flourishing, from Epicurus to Aristotle, the group recognized the value in analyzing whether our community characterizes any of these perspectives.

To do so, we performed a sentiment analysis. This analysis was carried out while abiding by the ethics of web scraping, as emphasized in the fourth module on the dangers of irresponsible technology. Thus, we worked with 1,300 anonymously available text entries from the unofficial UE Freedom Wall, posted by the administrators of the public page. After data cleaning, we proceeded to model our data using a Department of Science and Technology–Advanced Science and Technology Institute (DOST–ASTI) Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework, trained on a 10-billion-token Tagalog dataset.

We ultimately learned that only around 33% of the entries exhibited positive sentiment (lighter shades) while 44% exhibited negative sentiment (darker shades). While this analysis does not directly answer whether Red Warriors are happy, it provides a preview of whether the community leans toward the happier side. However, contrary to the traditional data lifecycle, we did not proceed with automated data visualization. Instead, we confronted Heidegger’s concern from the second module: the danger of enframing.

In his essay, Heidegger defines technology as a mode of revealing. Specifically, modern technology’s enframing orders the world so that people appear as mere resources. This poses a danger, as what shows up as “standing-reserve” can be treated as disposable assets. Our project responds to this critique creatively: rather than producing dashboards that reduce sentiments to mere data points, we transformed the results into a painting that represents the shades of what students feel. Through this, we move beyond enframing and allow people’s voices to inspire art. Abstract in form but rooted in lived emotions.

In a way, we hope that this interpretation may one day be redefined into a much lighter palette, one that represents the flourishing of the Red Warriors, whether through subjective engagement or objective worth. But for now, this is a representation of the *shades of Warriors*.
